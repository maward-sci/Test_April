Questions for Nicole Fish
May 5th 2020

- box vs. github
- integrating google drive with github: 
no just use links.

- editing spreadsheet on github no can do, but yes to text files & code:
Can edit a .csv file directly on github but a fancier spreadsheet just use a link to the google sheet to directly edit

- what’s the difference btwn a wiki & a readme:
Readme is text only and uses markdown. wiki is github’s way of better documentation. wiki is the long form version of a readme. Only one readme per folder. Readme is industry standard but they're trying to start a transition to separate definitions i.e. longform/shortform

- workflow under “actions” seems out of our needed scope, but is there something conceptually we should take away from it/ implement? 
no we don’t need it unless we come up with something that should be automated.

- number system of issues/commits/everything is assigned a number?
helps with tracking to automate moving things on the trello-like board. under issues you see open/closed and if you change the filtering system you can see both issues and commits and open & closed.

- what is a fork, hello world does not introduce this concept:
fork is similar to a branch but is a siloed branch i.e. saving someone else’s repository to your account. it’s good for exercises for your own personal workspace w/o collaboration.

- does the repository ever get too big such that wanting to only modify one file in a repo still requires an entire branch?
only an issue to navigate a large repo. the purpose is to do exactly this. It’s only pulling down the changes since your last pull 

- if merging, how to accept one but not all changes w/o individual commits. Sarah’s deleted a file & changed code, wants to keep the changes to code but keep the file:
cherrypicking function ftw!

- undo a commit:
this is common, easy to do on the desktop app or from terminal. just going back to the previous version, basically the whole point of version control

- organization of a repo
- how do you reorganize files & folders: specifically can’t drag and drop, how do you edit pathway?
if one person download the repo and rearranges 


- “Network” under “Insights” visual representation v helpful but still don’t understand what actions we did

- how do you merge multiple branches once the master has already been updated? Is this even an issue?
merge branches back to master often. Rebase to do so.
