Questions for Nicole Fish

- box vs. github
- integrating google drive with github: 
no just use links.

- editing spreadsheet on github no can do, but yes to text files & code:
Can edit a .csv file directly on github but a fancier spreadsheet just use a link to the google sheet to directly edit

- what’s the difference btwn a wiki & a readme:
Readme is text only and uses markdown. wiki is github’s way of better documentation. wiki is the long form version of a readme. Only one readme per folder. Readme is industry standard but they're trying to start a transition to separate definitions i.e. longform/shortform

- workflow under “actions” seems out of our needed scope, but is there something conceptually we should take away from it/ implement? 
no we don’t need it unless we come up with something that should be automated.

- number system of issues/commits/everything is assigned a number?
helps with tracking to automate moving things on the trello-like board. under issues you see open/closed and if you change the filtering system you can see both issues and commits and open & closed.

- what is a fork, hello world does not introduce this concept:
fork is similar to a branch but is a siloed branch i.e. saving someone else’s repository to your account. it’s good for exercises for your own personal workspace w/o collaboration.

- does the repository ever get too big such that wanting to only modify one file in a repo still requires an entire branch?
only an issue to navigate a large repo. the purpose is to do exactly this. It’s only pulling down the changes since your last pull 

- if merging, how to accept one but not all changes w/o individual commits. Sarah’s deleted a file & changed code, wants to keep the changes to code but keep the file:
cherrypicking function ftw!

- undo a commit:
this is common, easy to do on the desktop app or from terminal. just going back to the previous version, basically the whole point of version control

- organization of a repo
- how do you reorganize files & folders: specifically can’t drag and drop, how do you edit pathway?
if one person download the repo and rearranges on their local repo i.e. their computer using Finder or whatever and then push back to the cloud i.e. github and all of the organizational changes will be the new master that everyone else can work/pull from

- “Network” under “Insights” visual representation v helpful but still don’t understand what actions we did

- how do you merge multiple branches once the master has already been updated? Is this even an issue?
merge branches back to master often. Rebase to do so.
